# Big Bang Quiz
**Version 1.0.0**

The Big Bang quiz is a quiz targeted towards fans of the TV show 'Big Bang Theory'. It's purpose is to test their knowledge of the show and their memory. This is what makes it fun to engage with and helps fans relive some of the best moments of the show. 

The quiz features questions relating to scenes and moments from all 12 seasons. All facts and answers were found on bigbangtheoryfandom.com and all answers can be checked if they're correct or not on there. I designed this quiz with the goal of alleviating people's boredom, whether that be at home or at the office; this quiz can provide you with a good dose of dopamine and also offer a chalenge of the memory as some of the questions can be quite tricky to pinpoint.
